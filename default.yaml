# NOTICE  If these directories are not in cwd (./), then links will be created there (by startup.m)
#         This is so that there are always  some valid 'data' and 'metadata' dirs in ./
# NOTICE: metadata is divided into directories corresponding to the projects and are
#         saved in the git repo. If using a remote metadata dir (i.e. not inside ./), the same
#         structure is created in that dir (and those metadata are NOT saved in the git repo)
# NOTICE: data is not saved in the git repo and should be properly defined in the project.yaml
#         Using './data' will just create an empty dir (into where imported data will be saved)
